try cronjob for "energy", every 10 minutes it refills for users, if it can.

it would need to refill even if they are offline though, in the DB

Same goes for background jobs and whatnot, if those will be a thing. Could just 
do time the way fallen london does it with cards and each one you pick represents the time. but still need to control how often the cards refresh. but again that could be a global timed/scheduled action every 10 minutes
